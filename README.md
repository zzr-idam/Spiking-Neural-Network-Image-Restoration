# Spiking-Neural-Network-Image-Restoration
Image restoration using spiking neural networks.


# Method
We used spiking neurons to build a U-shaped network in which a small number of conventional convolutional layers were employed to achieve image super-resolution. In addition, we used a multi-step model with Poisson coding.
